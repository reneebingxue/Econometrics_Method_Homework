This folder includes R code used for my homework assignment in the master's level econometrics course Econometrics Methods. main.R conducts estimation with an ordinal probit model with 4 estimators: MLE, NLLSE, Just-ID GMM, and Over-ID GMM, each defined in a respective function file.
Assignment_1_MC.R investigates the consistency and asymptotic normality performance of the 4 estimators through Monte-Carlo simulation.
Bingxue_Li_HW_EM.pdf includes the derivation of the 4 estimators.
