This folder includes R code used for my homework assignment in the master's level econometrics course Econometrics Methods. main.R conducts some bootstrap exercises,trinity of tests with respect to a maxiumum likelihood estimator, and a wald type bootstrap test. 
J_1.R returns the information matrix of Maximum Likelihood Estimation. OP_LL_bnull.R returns a function for constrained estimator (baseline: OP_LL.R).Probit_LL_grad.R returns the gradient of the Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
Bingxue_Li_HW2_EM.pdf includes the derivation and explanation here. There might be some mistakes there.
